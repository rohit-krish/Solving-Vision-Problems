## 1. Baby Food

On a production line cans of baby food are made by:
1.  Fabricating the sides and lid of the can together but omitting the base of the can.
2.  Dropping a spoon into the empty upside-down can.
3.  Pouring the baby food (powder) into upside-down the can.
4.  Sealing the base onto the can.

You are asked to develop an inspection system looking at the can between steps 2 and 3 in order to check that a single spoon has been placed into it.
